# Learning-EJS

EJS, i.e., Embedded JavaScript allows us to build templates and layouts which will significantly improve the speed and functionality of any website having similar page or design structures, etc. 
I made a basic to-do-list which looks simple yet elegant. And how adding more than one page having similar css can be achieved using EJS. The dynamic addition of yet-to-do schedule fascinated me which could be made possible using few lines of code. 

Thanks :)
